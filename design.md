Design Document for Website Data Scraper Chrome Extension
1. Overview
The Website Data Scraper Chrome Extension is designed to allow users to extract structured data from any website in a Chrome tab. The extension will use a combination of a popup interface, content scripts, and background scripts to achieve this. The design prioritizes usability, performance, and compatibility with Chrome’s extension architecture.
2. System Architecture
2.1 Components

Popup: A user interface rendered via popup.html and styled with Tailwind CSS. It includes buttons, input fields, and a data preview table.
Content Script: A JavaScript file (content.js) injected into the active tab to scrape data based on user-defined rules or selections.
Background Script: A persistent script (background.js) to handle communication between the popup, content script, and Chrome APIs (e.g., chrome.storage, chrome.downloads).
Storage: Uses chrome.storage.local to save user configurations (e.g., saved selectors).
Manifest: A manifest.json file defining permissions, scripts, and extension metadata.

2.2 Data Flow

The user opens the popup via the Chrome toolbar.
The popup sends a message to the content script to initiate scraping or highlight elements.
The content script extracts data from the DOM using CSS selectors, XPath, or user-selected elements.
Scraped data is sent back to the popup for preview.
The user can export data, triggering the background script to generate and download a file or copy data to the clipboard.
Configurations are saved/retrieved via chrome.storage.

3. Technical Design
3.1 Manifest File (manifest.json)

Version: 3 (to comply with Chrome’s latest extension platform).
Permissions:
activeTab: To access the current tab.
<all_urls>: To work on any website.
storage: To save configurations.
downloads: To export files.


Scripts:
popup.js: Handles popup logic.
content.js: Handles DOM scraping.
background.js: Manages communication and file downloads.



3.2 Popup Interface (popup.html, popup.js)

Technologies: HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), JavaScript.
Components:
Start/Stop Scraping button.
Data type selector (checkboxes for text, images, links, tables).
Input field for CSS selectors/XPath.
Preview table for scraped data.
Export buttons (CSV, JSON, Copy to Clipboard).
Save/Load configuration options.


Behavior:
Sends messages to content.js to start scraping or highlight elements.
Displays scraped data in a table using a JavaScript library like DataTables (optional, via CDN).
Communicates with background.js for file downloads.



3.3 Content Script (content.js)

Functionality:
Listens for messages from the popup to start scraping or highlight elements.
Uses document.querySelectorAll for CSS selectors and document.evaluate for XPath queries.
Handles dynamic content by observing DOM changes using MutationObserver.
Highlights elements on hover using temporary CSS classes.
Extracts data (text, image URLs, links, table rows/columns) and sends it to the popup.


Error Handling:
Gracefully handles invalid selectors or inaccessible elements (e.g., shadow DOM).
Retries scraping for dynamic content with a timeout.



3.4 Background Script (background.js)

Functionality:
Listens for messages from the popup to save configurations or export data.
Uses chrome.downloads.download to save CSV/JSON files.
Uses chrome.storage.local to save and retrieve configurations.


Error Handling:
Handles permission errors or invalid file formats.



3.5 Data Formats

Scraped Data Structure (JavaScript object):{
  "text": [{ "tag": "h1", "content": "Example Title", "selector": "h1" }, ...],
  "images": [{ "src": "image.jpg", "alt": "Description", "selector": "img" }, ...],
  "links": [{ "href": "https://example.com", "text": "Link", "selector": "a" }, ...],
  "tables": [{ "rows": [["cell1", "cell2"], ...], "selector": "table" }, ...]
}


Export Formats:
CSV: Flattened structure with columns for type, tag, content, selector, etc.
JSON: The above object structure, stringified.



3.6 Storage

Configuration Format (saved in chrome.storage.local):{
  "configs": [
    {
      "name": "Example Config",
      "urlPattern": "https://example.com/*",
      "selectors": {
        "text": ["h1", ".title"],
        "images": ["img.banner"],
        "links": ["a.nav-link"],
        "tables": ["table.data"]
      }
    }
  ]
}



4. Security Considerations

Data Privacy: All scraping and processing occur locally. No data is sent to external servers.
Permissions: Use minimal permissions (activeTab, <all_urls>, storage, downloads).
Input Validation: Sanitize CSS/XPath inputs to prevent injection attacks.
Error Handling: Gracefully handle malformed HTML or blocked content (e.g., CORS restrictions).

5. Performance Considerations

DOM Access: Limit querySelectorAll calls by caching results where possible.
Dynamic Content: Use MutationObserver to detect changes instead of polling.
Memory: Avoid storing large datasets in memory; process and export incrementally.
Throttling: Limit scraping frequency to avoid overwhelming the browser.

6. Usability Considerations

Element Highlighting: Use a distinct border (e.g., outline: 2px solid blue) for hovered elements.
Feedback: Display loading spinners and error messages in the popup.
Accessibility: Ensure the popup is keyboard-navigable and screen-reader compatible.

7. Dependencies

Tailwind CSS: For styling the popup (via CDN).
Optional: DataTables or similar for displaying the preview table (via CDN).

8. Future Enhancements

Support for scraping multiple tabs.
Advanced selector builder (e.g., visual query builder).
Integration with cloud storage (with user consent).
Support for scraping authenticated content via user-provided cookies.

9. Risks and Mitigations

Risk: Websites block scraping via anti-bot measures.
Mitigation: Inform users to check website terms of service and handle rate-limiting gracefully.


Risk: Dynamic content fails to load.
Mitigation: Use MutationObserver and retry logic.


Risk: Large datasets cause performance issues.
Mitigation: Implement pagination in the preview table and incremental exports.
