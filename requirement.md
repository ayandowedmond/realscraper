Requirements Document for Website Data Scraper Chrome Extension
1. Project Overview
The Website Data Scraper Chrome Extension enables users to extract structured data (e.g., text, images, links, or specific HTML elements) from any website open in a Chrome browser tab. The extension will provide an intuitive interface for users to select elements to scrape, define data formats, and export the scraped data.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Data Scraping

FR1: The extension must allow users to scrape data from the active tab of the Chrome browser.
FR2: Users can select specific HTML elements (e.g., text, images, links, tables) using a point-and-click interface or CSS selectors/XPath queries.
FR3: The extension must support scraping of:
Text content (e.g., paragraphs, headings, spans).
Image URLs and alt text.
Hyperlinks (URLs and anchor text).
Table data (rows and columns).


FR4: Users can define custom scraping rules (e.g., scrape all <h1> tags or elements with a specific class).
FR5: The extension must handle dynamic content loaded via JavaScript (e.g., AJAX-loaded data).

2.2 User Interface

FR6: A popup interface must be provided, accessible via the Chrome extension toolbar.
FR7: The popup must include:
A button to start/stop the scraping process.
A section to display scraped data in a preview table.
Options to select data types (text, images, links, tables).
A field to input custom CSS selectors or XPath queries.
Buttons to export data (e.g., CSV, JSON).


FR8: A visual element selector must highlight elements on the webpage when hovered over for easy selection.
FR9: The interface must provide feedback (e.g., success, error messages) during scraping.

2.3 Data Export

FR10: Users can export scraped data in CSV and JSON formats.
FR11: Exported files must be downloadable via the browser with a timestamped filename (e.g., scraped_data_2025-07-19.csv).
FR12: The extension must allow users to copy scraped data to the clipboard in JSON or plain text format.

2.4 Configuration

FR13: Users can save scraping configurations (e.g., selectors, data types) for reuse on specific websites.
FR14: The extension must store configurations locally using Chrome’s chrome.storage API.
FR15: Users can clear saved configurations.

2.5 Permissions and Access

FR16: The extension must request permissions to access the active tab (activeTab) and all website data (<all_urls>).
FR17: The extension must work on any website, including those with HTTPS and dynamic content.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance

NFR1: The extension must scrape data from a webpage with up to 1000 elements in under 5 seconds.
NFR2: The extension must minimize memory usage to avoid slowing down the browser.
NFR3: The scraping process must not interfere with the webpage’s functionality or performance.

3.2 Security

NFR4: The extension must not store sensitive user data (e.g., scraped data) on external servers.
NFR5: All data processing must occur locally in the browser.
NFR6: The extension must handle malicious or malformed HTML gracefully without crashing.

3.3 Usability

NFR7: The interface must be intuitive for non-technical users.
NFR8: Error messages must be clear and actionable.
NFR9: The extension must support Chrome versions 88 and above.

3.4 Compatibility

NFR10: The extension must work on Chrome browsers across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
NFR11: The extension must handle websites with iframes, shadow DOM, and dynamic content.

4. Constraints

The extension must adhere to Chrome Web Store policies.
No external dependencies requiring network calls (e.g., external APIs) unless explicitly approved by the user.
The extension must not require server-side infrastructure.

5. Assumptions

Users have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS selectors or are comfortable using a point-and-click interface.
Websites allow scraping for personal use (users are responsible for complying with website terms of service).
The extension will not handle authentication-gated content unless the user is already logged in.

6. Out of Scope

Scraping data from multiple tabs simultaneously.
Support for other browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari).
Advanced data processing (e.g., natural language processing or image analysis).
Integration with external services (e.g., cloud storage).
